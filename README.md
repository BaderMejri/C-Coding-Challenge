# C++ -Coding-Challenge

This is a C++ program that can parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions. For example, on input 3+(5+(4*3))-12, the program return 8 or any other complex expressions with double data type. The program also detect an invalid input and report an appropriate error.

Supported Symbols requested :

Positive and negative double numbers.
+, -, *, / and parentheses.

You can try to run this code in any IDE by entering any expression in the console.

Error handling, parentheses and unary minus parsing are also added to the program below. Only three error messages are used:
 
"Erreur dans les parenthèses".

"Charactère non-valide".

"Division par zéro". 

When the interpreter sees an unexpected character anywhere, it returns the "Charactère non-valide" error code. 
The position in string where the error occurred is also shown. 
If there are several errors, only one of them will be reported.

Finally, a committed pdf document explains in details the algorithmic aspect of our code.
